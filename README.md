# football-game
End Semester project for OOP (java)

About the project:

==Description==

The project is bascically a 2D football game more precisely penalty shootouts developed in java with the following tools used "JavaFx library and Java Libraries".
The game works with the user interaction so user is the main backbone in running the game. The game is penalty shootout game which takes the user into the world of football and satisfies user's crave for penalty shootouts which are the most tense moments in football game.
 

==Requirements for running the project==

First of all extract the zip file and have all the uncompressed files on your computer.

This project is created on the "Intellij" IDE in java programming language so its better to have intellij IDE installed on your computer so that the game runs perfectly and smoothly.
The game is all about graphics so there have been sufficient amount of graphics inculcated in the game to meet the requirements of the game.

The game has many files but to play the game most important and having the utmost importance is "MainScreen" file. That is the file you have to run and compile on your computer to play the game. 
If you try to run other files they will not work because "MainScreen" file has the main method and acts as a base class and calls all other classes of the game by itself so your requirement is to run the MainScreen file and the rest of the things it will do itself.
Do not delete any of the files in the project that may damage the game and might become an hindrance in running the game and might not let the game behave properly. All files have importance in the project so do not any mistake of deleting any file.

If there are issues in running the project so that might be due to the path declared of different variables (like images and mp3 files) path in the project just try to change those path to the absolute path where those files are stored in your computer and always include javafx.media in your VM options.
